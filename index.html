        moral justice and dedicated work ethos. I approach my daily duties with enthusiasm and a keen eye for detail.

        of my knowledge. I possess a creative personality and greatly enjoy working as part of a team, however I have
        also acquired the confidence to utilise my own initiative, taking charge where necessary and ensuring that
        targets are reached on time and with the requisite quality.</p></ul>
